# Dining Philosophers üçΩÔ∏è

## üìñ Overview
The Dining Philosophers is a classic concurrency problem that demonstrates synchronization between multiple threads competing for shared resources.  

Imagine a group of philosophers sitting around a table. Each philosopher alternates between **thinking** and **eating**. To eat, a philosopher needs two forks ‚Äî one on the left and one on the right. Since forks are shared between neighbors, synchronization is required to avoid **deadlocks** and **race conditions**.

This program simulates the philosophers‚Äô behavior while ensuring:
- Philosophers don‚Äôt starve.
- No deadlocks occur.
- Shared resources (forks) are properly protected using mutexes.
- Logs of each philosopher‚Äôs actions are displayed with timestamps.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/csharpinthecsharp/Dinning-Philo.git
cd Dinning-Philo
```

### 2. Makefile
```bash
make
```

### 3. Run the simulation
```bash
./philosophers [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [optional:number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Example
Run a simulation with 5 philosophers:
-800ms before dying if they don‚Äôt eat
-200ms to eat
-200ms to sleep
